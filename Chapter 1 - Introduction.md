# Chapter 1 Introduction

I was a child when I first watched the movie “Inception” and was amazed by Christopher Nolan's imagination about “deep”. Build a layer of dreams enables the dream stealers to peek into the privacy of others and step into their inner world. What about two, three, or deeper dreams? In the movie, Leonardo DiCaprio builds a three-layered dream to help Japanese businessman Saito implant ideas in the head of the rival’s son. Such a fantasy story will not happen in real life, but today, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, people's lives have undergone tremendous changes. Due to the continuous development of the neural network and the rise of deep learning, as researchers, can we also use the method of deep learning to "implant" a better life into the future of humankind? This dissertation might not directly give the answers, but we will be able to generate some ideas of our own afterward.

### 1.1  Background
Deep learning is occupying the world. About a decade ago, deep learning was just an academic term stuck in the lab. Today, however, it becomes part of people's lives. The term is no longer just for researchers, but for people to talk about after meals and suddenly become the “future” in the eyes of investors. So, what is deep learning? Why did it attract so much attention? What can people do with it? In this section, we will introduce the most fundamental building blocks of deep learning from scratch, with a glance at some advanced principles and applications.

#### 1.1.1  Neural Networks
Neural networks were born a few decades ago. At that time, researchers had not learned about its extraordinary performance, and more of it just stayed in the corner of the laboratory as an upset direction. The neural network at that time was also very different from the current mainstream neural network. The former has only a simple network topology, few layers, and low-efficiency optimization, while the latter has a rich structure and derivatives, various optimization techniques, and much more efficient computing capabilities. Neural networks have gradually matured with ups and downs and become a hot subject today.
